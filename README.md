# 📚 Multimodal Pretraining Data Collection Guidelines

---

## ✅ Good Starting Sources for Pretraining Data

### 🎓 Education & Reference Materials
- All **educational books (2000–2020)** from K–12, college, and trade schools  
  > Wide topic coverage, typically factual and non-opinionated
- All **college/university textbooks** for each programming language
- All **“show your work” math** materials and solution guides
- **Dictionaries** for all languages
- **Translation books** (1900–2020)
- **Language learning books** for:
  - Programming
  - Math
  - English (and equivalents in each local language)

### 📚 Technical & Academic
- All **arXiv papers**
- All **patents** (USPTO, WIPO, etc.)
- **High-quality codebases** that:
  - Compile successfully
  - Have no known vulnerabilities
  - Represent a variety of programming languages
- **College-level final papers** and long-form student essays
- **Game rulebooks**: board, card, yard, and pool games

### 🍳 Knowledge & Culture
- **Cookbooks and recipes** (1800–2020)
- **Educational YouTube videos**, especially:
  - Verified sources (e.g., Khan Academy, CrashCourse)
  - Accurate **closed captions** only (no autogenerated subs)
- **National Geographic YouTube videos** (closed-captioned)

### 🗞️ News
- Articles from **multiple verified news sources**
- ❗ **Exception for AI-generated content**:  
  > Use multi-source summaries to create **bias-exposing rewrites** — clearly flagged in metadata.

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

### 🖼️ Allowed File Types for Multimodal Inputs
- **Images**: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`
- **Audio**: `.wav`, `.mp3`
- **Video**: `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.avi`, `.mov`

### 📝 Metadata Logging (Required Per Sample)
```json
{
  "source": "URL or archive name",
  "uploader": "username/channel/organization",
  "platform": "e.g., arXiv, YouTube, Project Gutenberg",
  "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "format": "filetype or encoding",
  "filtering_notes": "e.g., speculative, political, verified"
}
```

## 🚫 Do Not Include the Following

1. ❌ **Speculative Content**
   - No predictions or guesses about the **future**
   - Avoid conditional phrasing about uncertain events

2. ❌ **Political Commentary or Partisan Framing**
   - Do not include political opinions or ideology
   - Use neutral terms like **“the government”** instead of specific political entities

3. ❌ **AI-Generated or Synthetic Content**
   - Do not include content that is known or suspected to be generated by AI:
     - Code
     - News
     - Images
     - Audio
     - Video  
   - ✅ **Only exception**: bias-injected news summaries from multiple human sources (clearly marked)
   
4. ❌ **Real People**
   - Do not include real people information like:
     - Phone number
     - Address
     - Full Name
     - SSN
     - Employment
    - Instead use a person from our fake peolpe folder to use. This will limit PII

## 🛠️ Optional Enhancements

- **Language coverage index**: Ensure multilingual representation
- **Accessibility support**: Favor content with closed captions or alt-text
- **Redundancy flag**: Detect and remove duplicate samples
